# SQL-Music-Store-Sales-Analysis[EDA]
This SQL project provides a comprehensive analysis of online music store sales data using SQL queries. This project will walk you through from basic data retrieval to advanced insights. This analysis is based on structured question sets to guide the exploration of the music playlist database. In this project, I analyzed sales, customer behavior, genres, and more with three levels of difficulty.

NOTE: The album table is named album2 in the Database.
